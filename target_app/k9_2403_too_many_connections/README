IMAP servers have a max # of simultaneous connections limit

e.g. Gmail server has a limit of 15 simultaneous connections

Ths bug will be manifested if user manually set the # of "push" 
folder over the connection limit set by the server. By default,
the app works fine without this issue. 

##================================================================
In 2.800 release notes:

- Move the configuration for the maximum number of push folders to 
  the Incoming server Settings. -- danapple ## Notifications ##

- To help with battery life, give up trying to IMAP IDLE after 10 
  failures. -- danapple

- To help with battery life, increase IMAP IDLE retry delays -- danapple


Wakelock fixes (not sure if it's related to this bug):
Correct fault in IDLE WakeLock usage. The ThreadLocal in 
MessagingControllerPushReceiver meant that the WakeLock acquired 
when the DONE was sent was not being released when entering back 
into IDLE state. -- danapple

##================================================================
After the 2.800 fix, the issue still happens in the later version.
